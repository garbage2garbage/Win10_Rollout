
    run one or more commands provided by a file where each line in the file 
    will be processed the same as if it were entered on the command line, 
    one complete command per line (do not include the exe name)
    lines without a valid command will be ignored, the script will attempt
    to run all commands, with the exe returning the number of errors
    
    for script files only, environment variables can be embedded when 
    specifying filenames byenclosing the environment variable in <brackets>
    example-
    -regimport <tmp>\hkcu.reg
    
    a few lines from a sample file named myscript.txt- 
     -unpinstart all 
     -pinstart calculator "Microsoft Edge" weather 
     -wallpaper bing 
    would be run as follows- {exe_name} -scriptfile myscript.txt 

    additional options available only for scripts- 

    -delstartuplnk 

    delete any links (.lnk) to this exe in the current user's startup 
    folder- useful for run once scripts where a shortcut to this exe is 
    placed in the user's startup folder

    -writefile [ filename ]
    
    write the following lines in the script to a file, the start is marked 
    by the -writefile filename option, the end is marked with just the 
    -writefile option
    the main purpose is to allow embedding of reg files in a script
    
    example script which will write the embedded reg file to the current
    user's temp folder, then import it with the -regimport option
    
    -writefile <tmp>\hkcu.reg
