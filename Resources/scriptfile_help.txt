
    run one or more commands provided by a file where each line in the file 
    will be processed the same as if it were entered on the command line, 
    one complete command per line (starting with the -optionname)
    lines without a valid command will be ignored, the script will attempt
    to run all commands, with the exe returning the number of errors
    
    for script files only, environment variables can be embedded when 
    specifying filenames by enclosing the environment variable in 
    square [brackets], example-
    -regimport [tmp]\hkcu.reg
    
    a few lines from a sample file named myscript.txt- 
     -unpinstart -all 
     -pinstart Calculator "Microsoft Edge" weather 
     -wallpaper bing 
    would be run as follows- {exe_name} -scriptfile myscript.txt 
    
    == additional options available only for scripts ==

    -delstartuplnk 

    delete any links (.lnk) to this exe in the current user's startup 
    folder- useful for run once scripts where a shortcut to this exe is 
    placed in the user's startup folder

    
    -writefile [ filename ]
    
    write the following lines in the script to a file, the start is marked 
    by the -writefile filename option, the end is marked with just the 
    -writefile option
    the main purpose is to allow embedding of reg files in a script, but
    can also be used to embed other scripts
    
    to embed the -writefile command in a file currently being written, 
    use --writefile (which will be written as -writefile, but prevent the
    termination of the current -writefile operation)
    
    example script which will write the embedded reg file to the current
    user's temp folder, then import it with the -regimport option
    
    -writefile [tmp]\hkcu.reg
    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

    [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ContentDeliveryManager]
    "SystemPaneSuggestionsEnabled"=dword:00000000
    "SubscribedContent-338388Enabled"=dword:00000000
    -writefile
    -regimport [tmp]\hkcu.reg

    
    -message
    
    write the following lines in the script to the console, the end is
    marked by another -message option

    
    -continue?

    give the option to stop the script- anything starting with Y or y will
    continue with the script (enter key required), or else the script will
    exit
    normally preceded with a -message option
 
 
    -maximize
    -minimize
    
    maximize or minimize the script console window
    
    
    -needadmin
    
    exits if the user running the script does not have administrator 
    privileges- place at the start of the script to prevent partial script
    completion because the script was not run as adminstrator

    
    -runexe exename [ arguments ]
    
    run an executable program with optional arguments, if exename has 
    spaces it will need to be quoted
    arguments will be passed to the executable as-is
    examples-
    -runexe cmd.exe /c mybatchfile.cmd
    -runexe powercfg.exe /change monitor-timeout-ac 0
