 Notes
===============================================================================

<1> install Windows 10 from usb drive (Microsoft media creation tool)
<2> first run OOBE setup wizard- create a temporary user (see below)

  the temporary user will be used to run the customize.cmd script, and then
  deleted after logging into a new user account- this is just an easier
  option than to try to cleanup the first user which has all the Windows 
  default settings

  OOBE username option 1 (this will auto create the first new user later)-
  use 'temp<some name>', then a new user will be created with <some name>
  when the customize.cmd script is done running
  like- tempOwner  - tempOwner will be the temp user and Owner will be created
  by customize.cmd, tempOwner will need to be deleted later

  OOBE option2-
  use 'temp' as username, then you will be promted for a new user name 
  where you can type in the new user name

  OOBE option3- use any name
  a new user will need to manually be created with administrator priviledges
  (you can also create a password for the temporary user to prevent Windows
  from auto login at the next reboot)

<3> when at desktop (as temporary user) run customize.cmd (usb drive)
    (recommend without network connection to prevent Windows online activity)
  
    when done, restart
    log into new user, firstrun.cmd runs
    firstrun.cmd runs automatically
    delete the original temp user (only first new user needs to do this)
    turn on num lock if desktop pc or laptop with number pad
    connect network
    settings/apps/default apps, set program defaults as needed
    (foxit, chrome, vlc, etc.)
    settings/personalization/start, turn off recently added apps
    open/close Chrome 3 times to get rid of initial firstrun pages
    Microsoft Edge, open, click home button, copy home address, set as homepage
    (also click home button, dismiss google notification on web page- do
     several times until no more google info notifications)
    check date/time- can toggle auto set off/on in settings to force update
    run Windows update
