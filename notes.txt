 Notes
===============================================================================

* no network connection (a little nicer if Win does not detect internet)
* install Windows 10 from usb drive (Microsoft media creation tool)
* first run OOBE setup wizard- create a temporary user (see below)

  the temporary user will be used to run the customize.cmd script, and then
  deleted after logging into a new user account- most changes can be made
  to the current user, but because the start menu tiles is quite a mess because
  of suggested apps and cannot be removed via scripting (that I know of), its
  easier to just use a temporary user then delete it when no longer needed

  option 1 (auto create the new user)-
  use 'temp<some name>', then a new user will be created with <some name>
  when the script is done running
  like- tempOwner  - tempOwner will be the temp user and Owner will be created
  by customize.cmd, tempOwner will need to be deleted later

  option2-
  use 'temp', then you will be promted for a new user name where you can type
  in the new user name

  option3-
  a new user will need to be created with administrator priviledges
  (you can also create a password for the temporary user to prevent Windows
  from auto login at the next reboot)

* run customize.cmd (as administrator) from usb drive
* restart
* log into new user, firstrun.cmd runs (user will be given a choice)
* firstrun.cmd runs, then logs user out so changes take effect
* log back in
* delete the original temp user (only first new user needs to do this)

* turn on num lock if desktop pc or laptop with number pad
* connect network
* settings/apps/default apps, set program defaults as needed
  (foxit, chrome, vlc, etc.)
* settings/personalization/start, turn off recently added apps
* open/close Chrome 3 times to get rid of initial firstrun pages
* Microsoft Edge, open, click home button, copy home address, set as homepage
  (also click home button, dismiss google notification on web page- do
   several times until no more google info notifications)
* check date/time- can toggle auto set off/on in settings to force update

 customize.cmd (normally run after setup when logged into the temporary user,
                but can run at any time in any user account with admin
                priviledges)
===============================================================================
check if running as administrator
set timezone
HKLM registry changes
HKCU registry changes (to default user)
wallpapers
rename default user DefaultLayouts.xml (start menu tiles will be minimal)
copy helper files for firstrun.cmd
set computer name
change power profile (current is balanced) so power stays on when on ac
run Win32Apps\install.cmd if available
